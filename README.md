# AWESOME BOOKS
![](https://github.com/brytebee/AwesomeBooks)

## First JS Project: Awesome Project

In this project, I built a simple website that allows users to add/remove books from a library list of books. I used JavaScript objects and arrays. I also used vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation to simulate REACT and AJAX's single-page website concept. Lastly, I used is HTML and CSS3 technologies.
